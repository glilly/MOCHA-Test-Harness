Purpose
-------

MOCHA has multiple components including Java webservices, SQL database, VistA/M
client code, among others. This project aims to create a mock webservice that
can be used in testing or development and client code that can consume the
webservices provided by a MOCHA server.

Layout
------

The source tree is organized as follows:

* `<Client>`__: A client for MOCHA servers.
* `<Server>`__: A mock webservice server.
